# Labour 05: Stymphalian Bird

Goal: This labour is made to make you more efficient when starting a new project by automating all of the repetitive settings you usually have to do.

> Write a script that creates your project with at least a gitignore, if it’s a C project it has to add a Makefile and src/lib.
You’re script has to take options like the language of your project and the extend of the options (like if you’re including your libft or so).  

## How To Run
To run this script on a macOS system: 

1. Run the script
```
./automate <PROJECT_NAME> <OPTIONS> <SUBOPTIONS>
```

**_*Note:_** *To run this script on another OS, you will need to cross-compile the files in src.*
