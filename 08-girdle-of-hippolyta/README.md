## SMTP
SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the standard for passing email messages from one mail server to another. 
There are two ports youâ€™ll need to be aware of for SMTP:

- **Port 25:** This is the default SMTP port. It is not encrypted.
- **Port 465 / 587:** The default port for using SMTP through SSL.

An SMTP server understands very simple text commands like EHLO, MAIL, RCPT and DATA. The most common commands are:

- **HELO** - introduce yourself
- **EHLO** - introduce yourself and request extended mode  
- **MAIL FROM:** - specify the sender  
- **RCPT TO:** - specify the recipient  
- **DATA** - specify the body of the message (To, From and Subject should be the first three lines.)
- **RSET** - reset
- **QUIT** - quit the session
- **HELP** - get help on commands
- **VRFY** - verify an address
- **EXPN** - expand an address
- **VERB** - verbose
