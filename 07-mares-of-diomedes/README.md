# Labour 07: Mares of Diomedes
**Goal**  
For this labour you will release a dangerous pack of Mares, then steal them for King Eurystheus.

**Mandatory**  
*Create a script*  
    This script runs the included binary called manger, then stops the horses.

*Be creative*  
    try to find as many ways to stop the different steeds as you can.

*Recreate your own manger*  
    stealing the ideas and adding your own, to present to King Eurystheus to finish the labour. Make sure you understand the commands you are using! We are trying to learn here after all!

*Share the source code*  
    Donâ€™t be like Diomedes, who will not be showing you his source code  

**_- Note:_** *Something that hercules might not have known in the foreword could be **SIG**nificant*  
**_- Note:_** *What is really inside a binary? What system does it run on?*  
**_- Note:_** *The mares might crash the console session you run them in if not immediately attended*
