# Labour 07: Mares of Diomedes
**Goal**  
For this labour you will release a dangerous pack of Mares, then steal them for King Eurystheus.

**Mandatory**  
Create a script that runs the included binary called manger and then stops the horses. Be creative and try to find as many ways to stop the dierent steeds as you can. Recreate your own manger (stealing the ideas and adding your own) for King Eurystheus to finish the labour. Make sure you understand the commands you are using! (We are coders after all, damn it!) Finally, be sure to the source code for your manger. (Donâ€™t be like Diomedes)  

**_- Note:_** *Something that hercules might not have known in the foreword could be **SIG**nificant*  
**_- Note:_** *The mares might crash the console session you run them in if not immediately attended*
