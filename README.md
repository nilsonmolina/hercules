        The first of Hercule’s twelve labours, set by King Eurystheus (his cousin) was to slay the Nemean lion. According to one version of the myth, the Nemean lion took women as hostages to its lair in a cave near Nemea, luring warriors from nearby towns to save the damsel in distress. After entering the cave, the warrior would see a woman (usually feigning injury) and rush to her side. Once he was close, the woman would turn into a lion and kill the warrior, devouring his remains and giving the bones to Hades. Hercule wandered the area until he came to the town of Cleonae. There he met a boy who said that if Hercule slew the Nemean lion and returned alive within 30 days, the town would sacrifice a lion to Zeus; but if he did not return within 30 days or he died, the boy would sacrifice himself to Zeus. Another version claims that he met Molorchos, a shepherd who had lost his son to the lion, saying that if he came back within 30 days, a ram would be sacrificed to Zeus. If he did not return within 30 days, it would be sacrificed to the dead Hercule as a mourning offering. While searching for the lion, Hercule fetched some arrows to use against it, not know- ing that its golden fur was impenetrable; when he found the lion and shot at it with his bow, he discovered the fur’s protective property when the arrow bounced harmlessly off the creature’s thigh. After some time, Hercule made the lion return to his cave. The cave had two entrances, one of which Hercule blocked; he then entered the other. In those dark and close quarters, Hercule stunned the beast with his club and, using his immense strength, strangled it to death. During the fight the lion bit off one of his fingers. Others say that he shot arrows at it, eventually shooting it in the unarmoured mouth. After slaying the lion, he tried to skin it with a knife from his belt, but failed. He then tried sharpening the knife with a stone and even tried with the stone itself. Finally, Athena, noticing the hero’s plight, told Hercule to use one of the lion’s own claws to skin the pelt. When he returned on the thirtieth day carrying the carcass of the lion on his shoul- ders, King Eurystheus was amazed and terrified. Eurystheus forbade him ever again to enter the city; in future he was to display the fruits of his labours outside the city gates. Eurystheus warned him that the tasks set for him would become increasingly diffcult. He then sent Hercule off to complete his next quest, which was to destroy the Lernaean hydra.

        As Hercules strangling the mighty beast, you are going to have to create a cave and stay in the shadows. So using vmware you have to create a virtual machine running the latest stable Debian release, once this cave is created, to stay in the shadows change the default ssh port to the port you deem hidden enough.

## Labour 01 - Lernaean Hydra
<span style="color:red">**_- Did not participate_**</span>  

**Goal**  
*In this project, you will start learning a little bit more about sockets and starts getting a brief overlook at how the network works.*

    <p>
        Eurystheus sent Hercules to slay the Hydra, which Hera had raised just to slay Hercules. Upon reaching the swamp near Lake Lerna, where the Hydra dwelt, Hercules covered his mouth and nose with a cloth to protect himself from the poisonous fumes. He shot flaming arrows into the Hydra’s lair, the spring of Amymone, a deep cave from which it emerged only to terrorize neighboring villages. He then confronted the Hydra, wielding a sword. The chthonic creature’s reaction to this decapitation was botanical: two grew back, an expression of the hopelessness of such a struggle for any but the hero. The weakness of the Hydra was that it was invulnerable only if it retained at least one head. Realizing that he could not defeat the Hydra in this way, Hercules called on his nephew Iolaus for help. His nephew then came upon the idea (possibly inspired by Athena) of using a firebrand to scorch the neck stumps after each decapitation. Hercules cut off each head and Iolaus cauterized the open stumps. Seeing that Hercules was winning the struggle, Hera sent a giant crab to distract him. He crushed it under his mighty foot. The Hydra’s one immortal head was cut off with a golden sword given to Hercules by Athena. Hercules placed the head—still alive and writhing—under a great rock on the sacred way between Lerna and Elaius, and dipped his arrows in the Hydra’s poisonous blood. Thus his second task was complete.

    <strong>Intro</strong>  
    <p>
        Hercules wasn’t able to complete his Labour until he understood really how the hydra worked. Any true programmer must understand every ins and outs of things in order to subdue them. So for this project and in order to start subduing sockets, you have to build a server that to every ping would respond with two pong.

## [Labour 02 - Ceryneian Hind](02-ceryneian-hind)
**Goal**  
*Using the 42 API and any language you want, write a program to find the location of other users in the lab at 42US.*

<details>
    <summary><strong>Mythology</strong></summary>
    <p>
        Eurystheus and Hera were greatly angered to find that Hercules had managed to escape from the claws of the Nemean Lion and the fangs of the Lernaean Hydra, and so decided to spend more time thinking up a third task that would spell doom for the hero. The third task did not involve killing a beast, as it had already been established that Hercules could overcome even the most fearsome opponents, so Eurystheus decided to make him capture the female Ceryneian Hind, as it was so fast it could outrun an arrow. After beginning the search, Hercules awoke from sleeping and he could see the hind from the glint on its antlers. Hercules then chased the hind on foot for a full year through Greece, Thrace, Istria and the land of the Hyperboreans. He captured the hind while it slept, rendering it lame with a trap net.
    </p>
    <strong>Intro</strong>  
    <p>
        Hercules had to run for a whole year after the hind to finally catch it, it is a long time and hopefully it won’t take you that long to find what you’re looking for! In this project you’re going to have to find all your friends in the maze that the 42 zones are. You can do it by hand :( , going to every pages of there profile on the intra, you can go in the zones and shout their name... But if you do it this way, it’ll probably take you a whole year like Hercules, or as engineers you can build something that uses the API and automate this ;) .

## [Labour 03 - Erymanthian Boar](03-erymanthian-boar)
**Goal**  
*This project aims to give you a small approach on timed script commands and their execution.*

<details>
    <summary><strong>Mythology</strong></summary>
    <p>
        Heracles visited Chiron to gain advice on how to catch the boar, and Chiron had told him to drive it into thick snow, which sets this Labour in mid-winter. Having successfully caught the Boar, Heracles bound it and carried it back to Eurystheus, who was frightened of it and ducked down in his half-buried storage pithos, begging Her- acles to get rid of the beast, a favourite subject for the vase-painters. Heracles obliged. Roger Lancelyn Green states in his Tales of the Greek Heroes that Heracles threw it in the sea. It then swam to Italy, where its tusks were preserved in the Temple of Apollo at Cumae. Three days later, Eurystheus, still trembling with fear, sent Heracles to clean the Augean stables. 
    </p>
    <strong>Intro</strong>  
    <p>
        No one could catch that glorified pig as it was a mighty impressive and destructive beast. But that didn’t stop our hero and neither should it stop you on your mighty quest! Our hero was smart enough to now that to capture this foul beast, time is a very important part of it. In this labour, bruteforce or raw strength is of no use against that bone-breaking, mountain-destroying beast. Time was the most essential part of this labour...

## [Labour 04 - Augean Stables](04-augean-stables)
**Goal**  
*This project aims to help you get the basic notions of freeing memory in C.*

<details>
    <summary><strong>Mythology</strong></summary>
    <p>
        The fifth Labour of Hercules was to clean the Augean stables. Eurystheus intended this assignment both as humiliating (rather than impressive, like the previous labours) and as impossible, since the livestock were divinely healthy (immortal) and therefore produced an enormous quantity of dung. These stables had not been cleaned in over 30 years, and 3,000 cattle lived there. However, Hercules succeeded by rerouting the rivers Alpheus and Peneus to wash out the filth. Augeas reacted angrily because he had promised Hercules one tenth of his cattle if the job was finished in one day. He refused to honour the agreement, and Hercules killed him after completing the tasks. Hercules gave his kingdom to Phyleus, Augeas’ son, who had been exiled for supporting Hercules against his father.
    </p>
    <strong>Intro</strong>  
    <p>
        Happily for you in this labour you won’t have to clean stables of a very neglecting owner, you are coders for god sake! So for this project you still have to undertake a similar labour as our hero so you can become a hero yourself as well. As coders you won’t have to clean stables but rather a very poorly written code with lots of leaks in it. As our hero did with the two rivers you are going to be helped by two coding-rivers as well, they are called GDB and Valgrind. From Indonesia with Love!

## [Labour 05 - Stymphalian Birds](05-stymphalian-birds/)
**Goal**  
*This labour is made to make you more efficient when starting a new project by automating all of the repetitive settings you usually have to do.*

<details>
    <summary><strong>Mythology</strong></summary>
    <p>
        The Stymphalian birds were defeated by the hero Hercules in his Sixth Labour for Eu- rystheus. Hercules could not go into the marsh to reach the nests of the birds, as the ground would not support his weight. Athena, noticing the hero’s plight, gave Hercules a rattle called a crotala, which Hep- haestus had made especially for the occasion. Hercules shook the crotala rattle (same as Castanets) and frightened the birds into the air. Hercules then shot many of them with arrows tipped with poisonous blood from the slain Hydra. The rest flew far away, never to plague Arcadia again. Hercules brought some of the slain birds to Eurystheus as proof of his success.
    </p>
    <strong>Intro</strong>  
    <p>
         Hercules had to come in with the correct tools to defeat those plague carrying volatiles. A hero must always come with the right tools. We are a little bit more civilized nowadays and we don’t just shoot birds out of the sky like this. But modern hero still need to take on any new labour with the right set of tools.

## [Labour 06 - Cretan Bull](06-cretan-bull/)
**Goal**  
*For this labour you have to create a champion that will enter the Corewar arena and be worthy of it!*

<details>
    <summary><strong>Mythology</strong></summary>
    <p>
        Minos, King of Crete, asked the God Poseidon for a sign from the sea. The sign was a bull that Minos thought was too beautiful to kill. Poseidon, having been promised the bull would be sacrificed in his honor was furious. If Minos loved the bull so much, poseidon figured he would make Minos’ wife fall in love too. Daedalus was a skilled problem solver and creator of amazing inventions. He was brought by Minos’ god-possessed wife the problem of seducing the bull. Confused at her motives at first he helped her succeed. Known to never turn down a problem, Daedalus is better known for enabling his son Icarus to fly to his death. Notably after being imprisoned for helping the King’s wife elope with impressive livestock. Hercules was sent to capture the bull by Eurystheus as his seventh labour. He sailed to Crete, where King Minos gave Hercules permission to take the bull away as it had been "wreaking havoc on Crete by uprooting crops and leveling orchard walls." (King Minos is too shy to talk about his real problems) Hercules captured the bull, and then shipped it to Eurystheus in Tiryns. The bull later broke loose and wandered into Marathon, becoming known as the "Maratho- nian Bull". That bull might be the same one, but it’s another story. You only have today!

## [Labour 07 - Mares of Diomedes](07-mares-of-diomedes/) 
**Goal**  
*For this labour you will release a dangerous pack of Mares, then steal them for King Eurystheus using scripts.*

<details>
    <summary><strong>Mythology</strong></summary>
    <p>
        Eurystheus, always ready to send Heracles away again, sent him to steal the Mares of Thrace. Heracles was not aware that the mares had names, nor that they were kept tethered to a bronze manger because they were wild; Their madness being attributed to an unnatural diet of process threads and signals. Some versions say that they expelled fire when they breathed. Other versions talk about the awful stench of their mythical horse dung. They were computer-eating and uncontrollable, and Heracles left his best bro companion, Abderus, in charge of them while he fought Diomedes. When he returned he found out that his favorite guy was eaten. In revenge, Heracles fed Diomedes to his own horses, then founded the city of Abdera next to the boy’s tomb. In another version, Heracles stayed awake so that he didn’t have his throat cut by Diomedes in the night. He cut the chains binding the horses and scared the horses onto the high ground of a peninsula. Heracles quickly dug the land away from the ground with an axe to trap them on an island. When Diomedes arrived, Heracles killed him with the axe. The mares were only mad because they needed more processes to nom on. Heracles fed Diomedes to the mares to calm them until they could switch them to a diet of create core image signals. Both versions have eating make the mares calmer and easier to tame. Heracles captures them easily and takes them back to King Eurystheus, who dedicated the mares to Hera. In some versions, they were allowed to run free forever, having become permanently calm. In other versions Eurystheus ordered the horses taken to Olympus to be sacrificed to Zeus. Zeus refused them, and ran commands to interrupt and kill them.

    <strong>Intro</strong>  
    <p>
        Hercules was told to steal some mares finding to find out quickly they were dangerous and wild! Releasing them required he act quickly to finish the labour and continue forth. Leaving chaos behind for follow-up stories.

## Labour 08 - Girdle of Hippolyta
**Goal**  
*For this labour you write a program to send mail via SMTP.*

<details>

    <p>
        King Eurystheus, who is always ready to make his daughter happy, and send Heracles away again to die, commanded him to bring back the Girdle of Hippolyta... Heracules was not bothered by the task, he was prepared for anything. Well, maybe not to fight a whole army by himself. He emailed all of his friends to form an army to fight the Amazons. He also emailed Hippolyte, explaining the situation, asking for the girdle. Heracules checked his email. His bros and warriors alike responded quickly. He set off toward Queen Hippolyte and her tribe. Although the piece of armor was special, given to her because she was the best warrior among the Amazons, she sent a reply to Heracules, saying he could have it. This made Hera super angry, while she read their emails. The army arrived and it was too late. Although Hippolyta was ready to hand over the girdle, the angry godess Hera had given bad omen to Heracules arrival. Heracules stabbed Hippolyta and their armies fought! Returning to Eurystheus back in Mycenae, Heracules checked his email again. Seeing the message from Hippolyta, ignoring it. Then a quick ’reply all’ to his friends. The labour was done. This was just one of many versions of this labour, but in no version does Heracules do anything about killing Hippolyta..
    </p>
    <strong>Intro</strong>  
    <p>
        Heracules wasn’t about to fight that army alone. In this story we saw Heracules using SMTP to contact his army and Hippolyta. For this labour, let’s use SMTP to recreate these moments!
